## How to Run / Test
(This shows you've thought about testing)
1.  **Prerequisites:** Setup AWS CLI profiles for central and spoke accounts. Install Ansible and `boto3`.
2.  **Setup IAM Roles:** Apply the provided IAM policy in the spoke accounts to grant the central account necessary permissions.
3.  **Run the Playbook:** Execute with the dynamic inventory:
    `ansible-playbook -i scripts/ec2_dynamic_inventory.py playbooks/site.yml`

## Ansible Artifacts
The core logic is in the `/playbooks` directory.
